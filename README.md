Daily Task Tracker üìù
Description

A simple web-based Daily Task Tracker built with Python and Flask.
This app helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently with features like adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

Tasks are now stored in a cloud-based PostgreSQL database (Neon DB), making the app fully functional online. The frontend uses a modern dark violet and white gradient theme for a clean and visually appealing interface.

The app is deployed on Render, so it can be accessed from anywhere without the need for a local database.
