# Daily Task Tracker 📝

Description
A sleek, web-based Daily Task Tracker built with Python and Flask. Designed to help users efficiently manage daily tasks — add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed — all in a responsive and visually appealing interface.

The app stores data in a cloud-based PostgreSQL database (Neon DB), enabling full online functionality. The frontend features a modern dark violet and white gradient theme, delivering a clean and intuitive user experience.

Deployed on Render, the app is accessible from anywhere, eliminating the need for a local database.
